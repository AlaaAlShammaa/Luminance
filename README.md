# Luminance
Luminance is a system tray application inspired by Lumen (https://github.com/anishathalye/lumen) that adjusts the brightness of your screen
based on it's foreground contents.
It'll automatically brighten your screen when you're looking at a dark window (e.g: Terminal) and automatically darken your screen 
when you're looking at a bright window (e.g: a web browser)
<b> Luminance </b> is built in Java and it's targeted for Windows users only.
Linux support will be added later.
